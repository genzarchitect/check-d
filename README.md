## üìã Overview  

The **Arena Booking System** is a robust, scalable web platform built using microservices architecture designed to manage arena bookings for various events. Users can search for available arenas, view schedules, and make bookings. Administrators can manage arenas, handle booking conflicts, and generate reports. The platform integrates with **Razorpay** for payment processing and uses **MongoDB** for flexible data management.  

This system leverages key microservices principles such as **API Gateway**, **role-based access control**, **multithreading**, and **scalability** to handle high traffic efficiently. Backend services are deployed in **Docker containers** to ensure portability, scalability, and consistency across environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies  

### Backend:  
- **Java Spring Boot** for building microservices-based RESTful APIs.  
- **MySQL** for managing relational data with Hibernate ORM.  
- **MongoDB** for flexible, non-relational data storage (for certain services).  
- **Spring Security** for robust authentication and role-based authorization.  
- **API Gateway** (using Spring Cloud Gateway) for routing requests to respective microservices.  
- **RabbitMQ/Kafka** (optional for asynchronous messaging) for inter-service communication.  
- **Razorpay** for payment gateway integration to handle secure payments.  

### Frontend:  
- **Angular** for a dynamic and responsive user interface, with components for booking management, schedules, and user interaction.  

### Other Tools:  
- **Docker** for containerizing each microservice and managing multi-container applications using Docker Compose.  
- **Swagger** for API documentation, providing an interactive and self-updating guide to all API endpoints.
