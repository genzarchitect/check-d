## üìã Overview  

The **Arena Booking System** is a robust, scalable web platform built using microservices architecture designed to manage arena bookings for various events. Users can search for available arenas, view schedules, and make bookings. Owners can manage arenas, handle booking conflicts, and generate reports. The platform integrates with **Razorpay** for payment processing.  

This system leverages key microservices principles such as **API Gateway**, **Role-based access control**, **Multithreading**, and **Scalability** to handle high traffic efficiently. Backend services are deployed in **Docker containers** to ensure portability, scalability, and consistency across environments.
